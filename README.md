# Ascent
***NOTE: This is in active development and is not yet available. Please see the Version 1 milestone for more information.***

Tired of losing money? Can't seem to find where it's going?? Well I've got the solution for you!!!
Introducing Ascent! A simple, yet powerful, way to track your spending.
Simply add your day-to-day spending habits and Ascent will give you beautiful visuals for where all your hard-earned cash is going.
Each transaction recorded with Ascent needs to have at least one Tag applied, which is where the real power kicks in.
Tags are basically categories that can overlap. Let's say you go to your favorite restaurant, Olive Garden, and have a few too many breadsticks.
That transaction can be labeled as "Eating Out" or "Wants" or anything you like! And if the shoe fits, add more than one tag. 
Each tag is tracked independently, letting you see exactly what you're doing with your wallet.

# How Do I Get This?
Here's the good news: It's FREE!!! Since this project is built using so many wonderful open-source tools, Ascent follows the same pattern.
This app can be built from source right here! There will also be pre-built binaries available for download, but I'm considering selling access to them for a small fee/donation (me and my family are hungry).
But this app is 100% free! There is no pressure to buy a pre-configured binary and setting it up from source is quick and easy. Instructions will follow upon the release of Version 1 (see Milestones page for progress).
